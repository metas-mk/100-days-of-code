# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Mark Krake (@metas-mk)

The log of my 2nd Round of #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 19, Friday, 2019].

## Log
In my first life I was a COBOl and Mainframe Software Developer. Being a Product Owner and Requirements engineer in the last decade, I did not code anymore and found out that I was missing it like hell. I made a plan to get back into coding frequently and am now on a mission learning JavaScript and ReactJS. I started my personal #100DaysOfCode challenge on March 24th 2019 but only logged my daily progress via Twitter (@markkrake). I'm starting the 2nd round an will log my progress here.
